# This is an example inventory file for using the playbooks in this repo.
# Note that I'm using a role called "sethostname" to change the hostname
# of each host, according to the per-host value "setname" defined below.
# An "etchosts" role then sets up /etc/hosts according to the system
# hostnames.

# Several of the roles assume the name of the head node will be "head".
# Their defaults/main.yml files should make it clear where this is needs
# to be changed if you don't want that name.

# Other roles assume the groups "compute" and "cluster" are being used to
# group the compute nodes and the entire cluster, respectively. Again, this
# group name is usually defined as a variable in defaults/main.yml so you
# can change it.

[compute]
